                        <strong>localstorage:</strong> The localStorage object allows you to save key/value pairs in the browser. And it  stores data with no expiration date.
                        persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration. <br>
    
                        <strong>sessionstorage:</strong> The sessionStorage object also let you store key/value pairs in the browser. But it stores data for only one session.
                        sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.

                    <strong>localscope: </strong>  variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the local scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped. <br>
                    <strong>blockscope: </strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. <br>
                    let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.

                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br>
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                    Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
